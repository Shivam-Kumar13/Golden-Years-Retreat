          <h3>Who is Golden Years Retreat?</h3>
          <p>The society of elders have given us unconditional love, shown us parental support, taught us lessons
            from
            fables, made us who we are today and built a sense of community that is perfect for us to grow in. It is
            now
            up
            to us to give back, while they are in their second childhood. We hold the power of a disciplined
            background
            and
            loving hands tending to their everyday needs. <br><br>

            Now you no longer have to choose between your career or education aspirations and the care for your
            loved
            ones.
            It is not just company that they crave, but to undertake daily responsibilities and activities. <br><br>

            Golden Years Retreat provides a safe haven, cocooning your family members like one of ours, making every
            day
            easier to achieve with a sense of familiarity and self-actualization with our passion to making moments
            into
            more memories, while still living in the comfort of their own homes.</p>

          <h3 id="whyus">Why Golden Years Retreat?</h3>
          <p>Love as well as moral obligation are the driving factor to attempt giving back to our parents how they
            brought
            us up as children. It is time for us to nurture their new adolescence. While our professions separate
            us,
            our
            moral obligation to address their daily needs feels incomplete even at best effort. <br><br>
            With Golden Years Retreat, no senior citizen should have to feel lonely or unattended to. Spending time
            with
            them is just a minor part of what you can do, but what is required more is focused attention to making
            their
            life easier and convenient as they saunter towards their sunset years. <br><br>
            With a team of experts from the defense background, we are soldiers who were defending our country, now
            looking
            after those who made the country what it is today. A call away, the family of Elcare shall be ready to
            address
            any emergency, crisis, or even regular assistance to help fulfil the basic necessities for our founding
            fathers
            and mothers.</p>
